# Hand Sign Detection

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to build a program that can detect alphabetical signs of American Sign Language (ASL) from the user using a webcam. The project is broken down into three tasks: data collection and preprocessing, modeling, and testing. The key concept of this project is to apply the `MediaPipe Hand` library to capture the coordinates of knuckles, wrists, and other distinguishable spots of a human palm known as hand landmarks as data, then use the dataset to train a feedforward artificial neural network model using `Keras API`. To demonstrate the result, the project also includes an interactive application that allows the user to test out the performance of the model and have a bit of fun with a speed spelling game! The following paragraphs will explain how to install and run each python file and the details of the project. 
 
### Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
The hand landmarks are represented in 2D coordinates based on their absolute positions within the webcam. Hence, the coordinate of `WRIST` is used as the origin to obtain the relative coordinates of other landmarks in order to ensure that all hand signs can be detected regardless of the hand's position within the camera range. Also, considering that the user's hand might rotate, the coordinates are rotated according to the degree between the line connecting `WRIST` and `INDEX_FINGER_MCP` and the y-axis. Lastly, divide all coordinates by absolute value of the largest x- or y-coordinate to normalise the data.

#### Instructions
Run the `dataCollection.py` file to collect dataset for modeling. The collected data is stored inside the `Data` folder as csv file with respect to the name of the file.  
#### Controls:  
- Press `s` on the keyboard to save data
- Press `q` on the keyboard to exit the program  

### Task 2: Modeling
Read in all the csv files into a dataframe. Shuffle the entire dataframe then perform a 20/80 training-test split. Fit the training dataset into the model and use the testing dataset to validate the accuracy of the model. The accuracy and loss history after each epoch can be checked in the plot generated after fitting the model.

#### Instructions
Run the `model.py` file to start modeling with the dataset collected previously. The model is saved inside the `Model` folder. 

### Task 3: Testing
A simple testing program that allows the user to examine performance of the model. Try out some signs and see if the model can correctly classified the corresponding signs.

#### Instructions
Run the `test.py` file to start testing. 

### Application: Speedy Hand Sign Game
An interactive app that helps the user to practice alphabetical sign language by playing a speed spelling game with sign language.

#### Instructions
1. Run the `app.py` file
2. Choose a difficulty
3. Press `start` to begin playing
4. The result will be shown after the game finishes
5. Press `close` to exit the app
